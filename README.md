## Project Overview

OD-MAS (On-Device Multi-Agent Security) is a revolutionary privacy-first Android application that implements behavioral biometrics for continuous device authentication. Our solution uses advanced multi-agent machine learning to analyze user behavior patterns in real-time, providing seamless security without compromising user privacy.

### Key Innovation

Unlike traditional authentication systems that rely on static credentials, OD-MAS creates a dynamic "behavioral fingerprint" by analyzing how users interact with their devices - touch patterns, typing rhythm, and movement characteristics. All processing occurs entirely on-device, ensuring complete privacy protection.
